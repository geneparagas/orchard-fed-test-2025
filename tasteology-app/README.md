## Tastelogy Orchard Frontend test

I used Vite for fast setup and development, React for building interactive and reusable UI components, and Sass to write clean, responsive, and maintainable styles.

### Features

- **Basic operations**: onclick image modal, capture all anchor clicks, and `console.log()`
- **Responsive layout**: Optimized for mobile and desktop screens.
